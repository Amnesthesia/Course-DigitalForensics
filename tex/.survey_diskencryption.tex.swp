\subsection{Disk Encryption}
I assume that Disk Encryption also counts as anti-forensics and we should probably include at least something about it and how to counter it (i.e accessing the system when it's running, especially with transparent encryption). We could refer some to LUKS, dm\_crypt and the now-deprecated TrueCrypt here?
