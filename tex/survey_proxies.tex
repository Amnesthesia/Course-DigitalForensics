\subsection{Proxies}
By using a proxy-service a user could avoid any restrictions in outgoing or incomming communications or possibly just appear to be located somewhere he is not. There exists varying types of proxies, they are most commonly used to filter or monitor outgoing connections from a larger network, such as a corporation. While the direct connection from the client is towards the proxy address, in a corporate environment, logging of these connections is often implemented as a security measure, in case of https, it is possible for the proxy to act as a MITM to view the content of the traffic, this would however be evident to a user with some technical knowledge.


%Simple SOCKS and HTTPS proxies are probably something we should research and write a bit about as well, and how to fingerprint, identify and perhaps even trace somebody behind 7 proxies.
