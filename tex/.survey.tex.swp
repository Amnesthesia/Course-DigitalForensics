When researching the topic of this article, we looked into several known and previously covered issues with the use of TOR and anonymity.

One particular technology that has recieved quite a bit attentio the last year is "Canvas fingerprinting", a technology meant to replace cookies in tracking a unique user across websites. It functions by instructing the browser of the user to draw a figure, using html5, the variations in browser, GPU, drivers and other settings and specifications. It is possible to identify a user to some degree, while the previously mentioned settings are not always unique for every user the technology has some shortcomings.~\cite{wiki_canvas}

Somewhat related to this is the standard way of tracking unique users, cookies.
It exists many different types of cookies, but the the short summary of it is that its a very common way to track users across one or several websites. It has some shortcomings, due it usually being limited to the current browser/user/system.~\cite{wiki_cookie}
