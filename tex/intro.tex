\section{Introduction}
In this project we have looked at what kind of information it is possible to acquire from hosting your own TOR exit node / VPN server.
Most TOR exit nodes are hosted in a different country than your own, and some of these servers might cost a noticable ammount of money to keep up, due to the network traffic going through them. It is therefore interesting for us to know what kind of information the administrator of these servers can see and to what extent they can identify/fingerprint a user.

To summarize:
we have looked at what kind of information is visible such as usernames, e-mail adresses, user-agents, websites visited and much more..
%shoudl probably chagne the wording here, "and much more"...
