\section{Introduction}
For our project we chose proposal number 2: Experiment or theoretical analysis of cyber crime using VPN, TOR network or proxies for anti-forensics.

\begin{quote}
Anti-forensics methods are heavily used to avoid that digital investigators identify users committing cyber-crime, e.g. economic fraud, piracy (sharing/downloading unlawful material), or child pornagraphy. Digital forensics investigation is challenging when these techniques are used with regards to legal aspects and analysis techniques.

In this project we have looked at what kind of information it is possible to acquire from hosting your own TOR exit node / VPN server. \\

Most TOR exit nodes are hosted in a different country than your own, and some of these servers might cost a noticable ammount of money to keep up, due to the network traffic going through them. It is therefore interesting for us to know what kind of information the administrator of these servers can see and to what extent they can identify/fingerprint a user.
