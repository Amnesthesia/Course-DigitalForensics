During the research phase and the experimental phase of looking at the actual data certain facts became evident. \\

Without using encrypted protocols such as https instead of http or ssh instead of telnet, any malicious agent or investigator in control of a TOR exit relay, VPN-server or proxy, would be able to sniff sensitive information such as usernames and passwords with relative ease.\\

In cases where either the administration of the previously mentioned services lack the knowledge or will to follow up on their promise of complete anomity, a investigation after the incident would possibly divulge identifying information such as user credentials, IP-addresses or other information that could narrow down the scope of a continued investigation.\\

In todays global War on Terror, Drugs and Cyber-crime, international cooperation between law-enforcement agencies severely increases the technical level required of the criminals to stay out of the spotlight, which further pushes the development of anti-forensics.
